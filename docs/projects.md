### 1\. `C-Vector`: A Dynamic Array Library

# Project Title: `C-Vector` - A Generic Dynamic Array Library

## Overview

C++ has `std::vector`, a powerful tool for managing dynamic arrays. C arrays, however, are fixed in size. This project is about creating `C-Vector`, a library that provides a generic, type-safe dynamic array (vector) implementation in C. The library will manage its own memory, growing as needed when new elements are added.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a vector.
  - Get the current size and capacity of the vector.
  - Add an element to the end (`push_back`).
  - Remove an element from the end (`pop_back`).
  - Get or set the element at a specific index.
  - Automatically resize (grow) the internal array when its capacity is reached.

## Demo Application Idea

A command-line program that reads an unknown number of integers from the user, stores them in a `C-Vector`, and then prints them out along with the final size and capacity of the vector.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Dynamic Memory Management**: `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`.
  - **Amortized Analysis**: Understanding the performance of resizing.
  - **Generic Programming in C**: Using `void*` and `memcpy` to handle any data type.
  - **API Design**: Creating a clean and reusable interface.

Of course\! Here are two additional project ideas focusing on the stack and queue data structures, following the same format.

### 2\. `C-RPN`: A Stack-Based RPN Calculator Engine

# Project Title: `C-RPN` - A Reverse Polish Notation Calculator Engine

## Overview

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where operators follow their operands. For example, `3 + 4` is written as `3 4 +`. RPN expressions can be evaluated efficiently using a stack. This project is to create a library that parses and computes the result of an RPN expression string.

## Core Features

  - A robust, generic **stack implementation** for numbers (e.g., `double`).
  - A primary evaluation function that takes an RPN expression as a string (e.g., `"10 5 / 3 *"`).
  - Support for basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
  - Robust error handling for malformed expressions (e.g., insufficient operands, division by zero, invalid tokens).

## Demo Application Idea

A command-line RPN calculator. The program takes a single command-line argument—an RPN expression in quotes—evaluates it using your library, and prints the result or an error message.
`./rpn_calculator "15 7 1 1 + - / 3 * 2 1 1 + + -"`

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Stack Application**: A classic, practical use case for the stack data structure.
  - **String Parsing**: Using `strtok_r` or similar functions to break a string into tokens.
  - **Error Handling**: Designing an API that clearly communicates different failure modes.
  - **State Management**: Managing the stack's state throughout the evaluation process.

### 3\. `C-TaskQueue`: A FIFO Task Queue Library

# Project Title: `C-TaskQueue` - A Simple FIFO Task Queue

## Overview

Queues are fundamental in computing for managing tasks or events in a "first-come, first-served" manner. This project is to build a generic, queue-based library for managing a list of "tasks." A task will be represented by a function pointer, allowing the library to queue up different actions to be executed in order.

## Core Features

  - A robust, generic **queue implementation** (using a linked list is a good choice).
  - An API to add a task (a function pointer and its argument) to the back of the queue (`enqueue`).
  - An API to retrieve and remove the next task from the front of the queue (`dequeue`).
  - A helper function to run all tasks in the queue until it is empty.

## Demo Application Idea

A simple event simulator. The demo program will define several functions (e.g., `on_user_login(char* username)`, `on_file_download(char* filename)`, `on_db_query(char* query)`). The `main` function will add these tasks to the queue in a specific order. Finally, it will call `task_queue_run()` to execute all the queued tasks sequentially, printing messages to show they are running in the correct FIFO order.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Queue Application**: Understanding how queues are used for task scheduling and event loops.
  - **Function Pointers**: A powerful C feature for creating flexible, callback-driven systems.
  - **Generic Programming**: Using `void*` to pass arbitrary data to task functions.
  - **Decoupling**: Separating the "what" (the task functions) from the "when" (the queue's execution logic).

### 4\. `C-HashMap`: A Hash Map Library

# Project Title: `C-HashMap` - A Key-Value Hash Map Library

## Overview

Many modern languages have built-in dictionaries or hash maps. This project involves building a hash map in C to store key-value pairs. Your library should handle string keys and `void*` values, allowing it to store any type of data. It must efficiently handle hash collisions.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a hash map.
  - Insert a key-value pair.
  - Retrieve a value given a key.
  - Delete a key-value pair.

  - Implement a string hashing function (e.g., djb2).
  - Handle collisions using **chaining** (linked lists at each bucket).

## Demo Application Idea

A word frequency counter. The demo program should read a text file, use the `C-HashMap` library to store each unique word as a key and its frequency count as the value, and then print the results.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Hashing**: Designing hash functions and handling collisions.
  - **Data Structures**: Combining arrays and linked lists.
  - **Pointer Management**: Managing memory for keys, values, and nodes.
  - **API Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details from the user.

## Core Features

  - **Split**: A function to split a string by a delimiter into an array of strings.
  - **Join**: A function to join an array of strings into a single string with a separator.

## Demo Application Idea

A program that reads a line of comma-separated values (CSV), splits it into fields using your library, trims whitespace from each field, and then joins them back together with a different delimiter (e.g., a pipe `|`).

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **String Manipulation**: Deep understanding of C-style strings (`char*`).
  - **Advanced Memory Management**: Allocating and freeing arrays of pointers.
  - **Defensive Programming**: Creating APIs that are harder to misuse.

# Project Title: `C-PriorityQueue` - A Generic Priority Queue Library

## Overview

Implement a generic priority queue based on a **binary min-heap**. This data structure is essential for many algorithms (like Dijkstra's or Prim's) and scheduling systems. The library should allow users to insert items with a priority and always be able to extract the item with the highest priority (lowest numerical value).

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a priority queue.
  - Insert an element with an associated priority (or value).
  - Extract the element with the minimum value (`extract_min`).
  - Peek at the minimum element without removing it.
  - Store `void*` data pointers to be generic, with priority being an `int` or `double`.

## Demo Application Idea

A task scheduler. The demo prompts the user to add tasks with different priority levels (1=high, 5=low). The program uses the priority queue to store tasks and then "executes" them by always extracting the one with the lowest priority number.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Heaps**: Understanding the heap data structure and its properties.
  - **Array-based Tree Representation**: Mapping a binary tree to an array.
  - **Algorithm Efficiency**: O(log n) insertions and extractions.

  - A single sorting interface that takes an array (`void*`), element count, element size, and a comparison function pointer.
  - The comparison function should follow the same signature as the one for `qsort`.

## Demo Application Idea

A program that defines an array of custom structs (e.g., `struct Person { char* name; int age; }`). The demo will use your library to sort this array first by name (alphabetically) and then by age (numerically) by providing two different comparison functions.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Function Pointers**: A core concept for creating generic, callback-style APIs in C.
